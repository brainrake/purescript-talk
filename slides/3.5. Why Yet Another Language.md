## Why Yet Another Language


- every other compile-to-js language falls short

- a few come close, but miss important things:

    typescript
        nullable, verbose, mutable, complex oop

    elm
        nice FRP, but poor type system, no typeclasses, has runtime

    scala, ocaml, haskell -> js
        language artefacts, ugly js, hard interop, no/bad records/effects

    roy
        almost perfect, abandoned, inspiration for PureScript.

    idris
        holy grail: dependent typing; but no libraries, ugly js
