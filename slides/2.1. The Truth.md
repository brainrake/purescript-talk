## The Truth


- everything is connected

- Curry-Howard correspondence:
  lambda calculus and propositional logic are isomorphic.

        computation  ≡    logic

           type      ≡   theorem

          program    ≡    proof


- also applies to category theory:
  the "general abstract nonsense" that underlies all of mathematics. so:

       computation   ≡   logic   ≡   math


- also,
             Tests  ≪  Proof
